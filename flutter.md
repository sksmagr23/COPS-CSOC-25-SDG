# üê¶ COPS SDG Summer of Code 2025 - Flutter Track

## Pre-requisites

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Instead of installing the Flutter SDK directly, we highly recommend using **FVM** (Flutter Version Management) to manage SDK versions per project.

### üì¶ FVM (Flutter Version Management)

FVM allows you to manage Flutter SDK versions on a per-project basis, ensuring consistency across machines.
**Resources:**

* **Installation on MacOS:**[Install FVM on MacOS](https://youtu.be/CXhc2jrkgJ8?feature=shared)
* **Installation on Widnows:**[Install FVM on Widnows](https://youtu.be/BLLeT7DnEl0?feature=shared)
* **Documentation:** [FVM Official Docs](https://fvm.app/docs)
* **One-Shot Video:**[Flutter Quickstart Tutorial](https://youtu.be/BiOSCpV-lts?si=ljkGSU28-8T1Ibbj)
 
Your Task this week would be simply to get used to flutter as much as possible, as we will proceed to building the app form next week onwards after deciding upon the app we built..
